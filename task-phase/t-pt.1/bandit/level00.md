### _LEVEL GOAL_ ###

in the level 00, we have to login into the game using *SSH*.


#### About SSH ####
so SSH stands for secure shell protocol is a network protocol for unix systems to _SAFELY_ connect to an unsecured network [remote-login]. the connect to a remote host is secured and encrypted, which helps our data and passwords to be safe.


to remotely connect to a host, command-line execution is to be done w/ SSH.

synatx to connect to a host:
ssh[username]@[host] -p [port]

after this, enter the password and we will be logged in.
