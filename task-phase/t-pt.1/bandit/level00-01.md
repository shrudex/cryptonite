### _LEVEL GOAL_ ###
retrieve the password stored in a file - readme

so, **ls -alps** is a command used to list the files in the directory.
after listing the files, check for the _readme_ file.

to read the date from a file, **concatenate** command is used.

syntax used: cat [filename]

so _cat readme_ will display its content and hence we have retrieved the password for the level and we will login using that.

**exit** command will close the connection to previously logged-in host.
