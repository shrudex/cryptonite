we have to work with dashed filenames.

so,  in linux operating systems, dash (-) is generally used by commands to specify options and arguments.

syntax to read the contents of a file w/ dashed filenames:
cat ./[dashed-filename] OR cat < [dashed-filename]

since the password is saved in a filename called **-**, we will display the contents using: **cat ./-**
