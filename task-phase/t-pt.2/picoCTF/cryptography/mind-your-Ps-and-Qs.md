**DESCRIPTION** : In RSA, a small e value can be problematic, but what about N? Can you decrypt this? 

we get a _values_ file which we can download using the **wget** command in the terminal. it has RSA file.

so, **RSA** is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private).

the file has 3 values : _c_, _n_ and _e_. _n_ and _e_ are associated with the public key and _c_ is the **cipher key**.

using any web-based RSA decoder, we can decode.
